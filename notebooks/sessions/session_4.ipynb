    "In the last practical session, we saw how to run multiple behaviors in parallel on multiple agents. In this section we will see more advanced methods for combining behaviors by modulating their activations according to internal states of the agent and by allowing them to sense the attributes of others. In order to start with a clean basis, let's first provide the definition of several behaviors. These four behaviors are simply implementations of the [Braitenberg vehicles](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1s6ibk_ACiJb9CERJ_8L_b4KFu9d04ZG_htUbb_YSYT4/edit#slide=id.g31e1b425a3_0_0) we have seen in class, where the `sensed_entities` (i.e. what is sensed by the proximeters) are other `agents`:"

However, as seen in Q1 above, the agent might still be attracted to resources even when the `foraging` weight is null. Solve this issue by adding another behavior that drives the agent away from resources according to the energy level: the higher the energy level, the more the agent is repulsed from resourcess."

For example, one might want to define different species of agent (cats and mouses for example) so that how a agent interact with another depends on their respective species. To achieve this, each agent can be set with a specific attribute, e.g `agent.species = \"cat\"` and that attribute can be sensed by other agents whenever it is detected by a proximeter. Let's try it with three agents. \n",

    "**Q7**: Modify the previous simulation such that attraction and repulsion depend on how much a agent has been close to others in the recent past. To do so, define a `social_drive` routine that modulates the value of a `social_need` attribute in each agent. This social need continuously increases when other agents are far and decreases when a agent comes closer to its conspecifics."

    "The aim of the mini project is to show that you have understood all the concepts we have seen during these three practical sessions and that you can integrate them in a single demo. You can of course modify the V-REP scene at your will, e.g adding cups or trees. Don't forget to save you modified V-REP scene (`File -> Save scene as` in V-REP). You can start your project in a new Jupyter Notebook (`File -> New notebook -> Python3`) in the menu bar at the top of this notebook). Use both text cells (explaining what you are doing) and code cells (with the corresponding code to execute).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, your project will consists of two files: a V-REP scene (extension `.ttt`) a Jupyter Notebook (extension `.ipynb`). Don't forget to save them, e.g. on a USB stick, before logging out from the UPF computers. See [this slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FlAUyvNynYU4mDBE2o20pf2Bn5PC_9Id3SK8sCMfr-Q/edit#slide=id.g34900c6ead_0_0) for more information on the mini-project."
